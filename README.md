# changelog

`changelog.py` generates pretty standalone html files for the versions in your changelog.

See `example_changelog.json` for an example how the input changelog may look. Changelogs in `txt` format will be supported in the future.

**TODO:** example image for README and example changelog json and txt.

### TODO
* add parsing from txt changelogs
* copy to clipboard //OR// otherwise display full commit hash on demand
* create index list of all versions (with mark for if they contain breaking or additions etc..)
* allow code blocks in block names and make them appear a little bigger so they fit
* possibly want to move options for block splitting and sorting into the changelog itself?
