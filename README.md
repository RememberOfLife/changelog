# changelog

`changelog.py` generates pretty standalone html files for the versions in your changelog.

See `example_changelog.json` for an example how the input changelog may look. Changelogs in `txt` format will be supported in the future.

**TODO:** example image for README and example changelog json and txt.

### TODO
* add back button from specific version to index, but make it disableable if someone just wants standalone versions
* add button from index to ALL versions, but make it disableable
* add parsing from txt changelogs
* copy to clipboard //OR// otherwise display full commit hash on demand
* allow code blocks in block names and make them appear a little bigger so they fit
* possibly want to move options for block splitting and sorting into the changelog itself?
